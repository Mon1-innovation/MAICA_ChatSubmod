# Tips
1. Full functions will only be avaliable after affection reaches 100.
2. Unlocking events adds them to a waiting list, which means they won't be immediately triggered. Keep the game running and wait.
3. For troubleshooting, turning off 'Auto reconnect' and turning on 'Console' may help. Reconnect on options' change.
4. English/Chinese are fully supported. But the basic logics and trainings are based on Chinese, so expect performance reduction and higher possibility of functional issues by using English.
5. Does not support system http(s)/socks proxy. Turn it off.
6. You can delete `game\Submods\MAICA_ChatSubmod\donation` to hide donation link.
